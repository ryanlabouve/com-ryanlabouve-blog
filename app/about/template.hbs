    <h2 class="text-xl mb-0 mt-2">Professionally</h2>

    <p>
      I build internet things.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am a driven front-end web developer that loves taking ideas and making them scale.
    </p>

    <p>
      Startups are fantastic! This is where I typically find my like-minded group of people wanting to make the world a better place.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-0 mt-2">Personally</h2>

    <p>
      I love Jesus.
    </p>

    <p>
      His message captivates me at every level: heal the sick, looking beyond rich or poor, heart to restore the hurting and broken...
    </p>


    <p>
      (Though sometimes I find myself at odds with the steroytypical Christian, but I think Jesus might too?)
    </p>

    <p>
      I love my family. My wife and daughter amaze me daily. I love to be with them.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-0 mt-2">Other Stuff</h2>

    <p>
      Youâ€™re more likely to find me reading or sitting outside than watching sports or reality shows. But I do appreciate a good many movies.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy red meat, loud music, reading, lifting weights, running, and being outside.
    </p>
